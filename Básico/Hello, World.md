- Compiled language -> Needs to be compiled, and the executable of this language will run under certain circumstances
	- For example, the executable of your code will be executable only for the machines using the same kernel as yours
- Needs to be understood the memory dynamics before-hand 


- In order to access printf -> Import stdio.h
	- To import `#include <stdio.h>`
	- This way we will have this function, which will do a lot for us instead of ourselves going out to build every contraption in order to use and modify every memory slot, cpu elements, and all of those things

- `int main() { return 0; }` -> The function **main** will return an integer

- Every line must end with a semicolon, or **;**
