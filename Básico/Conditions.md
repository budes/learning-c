**if**, **else**, **else if**

It would be structured like that possibly:
if (condition) {
	something;
} else if (condition2) {
	something-else;
} else {
	something-else-else;
}

Types of boolean operators in C are:
- Greater or Lesser than something -> `>` `<`
- Greater or Equal, and Lesser or Equal -> `>=` `<=`
- Different and Equal-> `!=` `==`
- Or and And -> `||` `&&`
- Not -> `!`
